A Django-based Web Application Implementing Gale Shapley Algorithm in the Medical Context.

## Credits
Since I had no prior experience in web-based designing, I had to rely on a few open source implementations for making the project aesthetically pleasing. Thanks to everyone whose designs helped me in reaching over to a final product. A special shout-out to [Srajan Garg](github.com/srajangarg) and his team's work using CSS and Materialize that helped me in the beautification of the idea implemented above. The core design also helped me in coming up with a rather novel way of representing the data and the algorithm involved.
